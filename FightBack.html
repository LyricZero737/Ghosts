    <h1>Things you can do to defend yourself from Ghosts</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Get a local priest to bless holy water, or salt and have it on hand to throw at ghosts</li>
        <li>Find out the story of the ghost and see if you can finish their unfinished business</li>
        <li>Buy Ghost busters equipment and try your luck</li>

    </ul>
    <p>If none of these work and you get unalived we are not responsible for your life choices.</p>
